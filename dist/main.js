But scientists believe some American lobsters may live to be 100 years old.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>They can weigh up to 44 pounds.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters must periodically molt in order to grow, shedding their hard, external skeleton (shell) when they grow too large for it and forming a new one. They eat voraciously after they molt, often devouring their own recently vacated shells. Eating their shell replenishes lost calcium and helps harden their new shell.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters molt about 20 to 25 times over a period of 5 to 8 years between the time they hatch and when they are able to reproduce and reach the minimum legal size to be harvested.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Usually, lobsters mate after the females molt. Males deposit sperm in the soft-shelled females. The female stores the sperm internally for up to a year.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Females can have 5,000 to more than 100,000 eggs, depending on their size. The eggs are fertilized as females release them on the underside of their tails, where they carry the eggs for 9 to 11 months.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Egg-bearing females move inshore to hatch their eggs during late spring or early summer.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The pelagic (free-swimming) larvae molt four times before they resemble adults and settle to the bottom.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Lobsters are opportunistic feeders, feeding on whatever prey is most available, so their diet varies regionally.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Larvae and postlarvae are carnivorous and eat zooplankton (tiny floating animals) during their first year.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Adults are omnivorous, feeding on crabs, mollusks, worms, sea urchins, sea stars, fish, and macroalgae.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In general, a variety of bottom-dwelling species feed on lobster, including fish, sharks, rays, skates, octopuses, and crabs.

The Gulf of Maine and Southern New England areas are predominantly inshore fisheries, while the Georges Bank area is predominantly an offshore fishery.

They bait rectangular, wire-mesh traps then lower them to the ocean floor in water 15 to 1,000 feet deep. A buoy that marks the trap’s location is attached to the trap line. Fishermen haul the traps back to the surface every few days to check their catch, although the frequency varies depending on the season and the location.</li>\n<li>The Northeast/Mid-Atlantic American lobster trap/pot fishery can incidentally entangle large whales. To reduce injuries and deaths of large whales due to fisheries interactions, the <a href="https://www.greateratlantic.fisheries.noaa.gov/Protected/whaletrp/">Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan</a> was implemented in 1997. Lobstermen must follow a number of regulations to protect large whales from fishing gear. For example, lobstermen must use sinking groundlines between traps to reduce the amount of line in the water column, which reduces the potential for whales and other protected species to become entangled. In addition, lobster permit holders are required to haul their active traps at least once every 30 days.</li>\n<li>Traps can incidentally catch finfish and invertebrates (such as crabs and conch). Regulations require traps to be configured with biodegradable escape panels or hinges on traps to prevent ghost fishing (lost gear that continues to capture lobster and other species and may pose a hazard to other marine species).

Species of Alexandrium cause HABs in New England that are commonly referred to as “red tides.” Alexandrium toxin becomes concentrated in shellfish such as quahogs. The shellfish themselves are not affected by the toxin, but eating shellfish tainted with this toxin can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal human illness. There are large-scale monitoring programs all along the coast to assess toxin levels in shellfish; if toxins are detected these areas are immediately closed to harvesting. Contamination from PSP has had a huge impact on fisheries for ocean quahogs. Georges Bank, where ocean quahogs are abundant, has been closed to fishing since 1990 due to the presence of PSP toxins in quahog tissue. In January 2013, a portion of Georges Bank was reopened to the harvest of ocean quahogs and surfclams by vessels using a new PSP testing protocol that was developed through the collaborative efforts of industry, scientists, and managers. This will allow safe harvest of these abundant Georges Bank resources.</li>\n</ul>\n',"Saturated Fatty Acids, Total":"0.094 g",Selenium:"24.3 mcg","Serving Weight":"100 g",Servings:"1",Sodium:"56 mg",Source:"<p>U.S. wild-caught from Maine to Virginia.</p>\n","Sugars, Total":"0 g",Taste:"<p>A somewhat stronger taste than other clams.</p>\n",Texture:"<p>Firmer than other clams.</p>\n",Path:"/profiles/ocean-quahog",last_update:"01/07/2022 - 10:47"},{"Fishery Management":'<ul>\n<li><a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/region/southeast">NOAA Fisheries</a> and the <a href="http://www.safmc.net/">South Atlantic</a> and <a href="http://www.gulfcouncil.org/">Gulf of Mexico</a> Fishery Management Councils manage the gray triggerfish fishery.</li>\n<li>In the South Atlantic, managed under the <a href="http://www.safmc.net/resource-library/snapper-grouper">Snapper Grouper Fishery Management Plan</a>:\n<ul>\n<li>Recreational and commercial fishery minimum length limits in federal waters off the east coast of Florida.</li>\n<li>Recreational bag limits.</li>\n<li>Annual catch limits and accountability measures, with automatic triggers to prevent overfishing if the catch limit is exceeded, including shortened future fishing season (recreational) or reduced future catch limits (commercial).</li>\n<li>Requirements to carry NOAA Fisheries approved sea turtle <a href="https://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html">release gear</a> and follow smalltooth sawfish <a href="https://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/protected_resources/outreach_and_education/documents/sawfish_handling_and_release_placard_2014.pdf">release protocol</a> to reduce bycatch impacts to protected species.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>In the Gulf of Mexico, managed under the <a href="https://gulfcouncil.org/fishery-management/implemented-plans/reef-fish/">Reef Fish of the Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Plan</a>:\n<ul>\n<li>Recreational and commercial minimum size limits, daily bag limits, and seasonal closures to promote spawning and slow the rate of harvest.</li>\n<li>Annual catch limits with automatic triggers to prevent overfishing if catch limit is exceeded, including shortened future fishing season (recreational) or reduced future catch limits (commercial).</li>\n<li>Requirements to carry NOAA Fisheries approved sea turtle <a href="https://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/sustainable_fisheries/gulf_sa/turtle_sawfish_release/index.html">release gear</a> and follow smalltooth sawfish <a href="https://sero.nmfs.noaa.gov/protected_resources/outreach_and_education/documents/sawfish_handling_and_release_placard_2014.pdf">release protocol</a> to reduce bycatch impacts to protected species.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n',Habitat:"<ul>\n<li>Adults live on hard ocean bottoms, reefs, ledges, and artificial reefs at depths of 80 to 300 feet, either alone or in small groups.</li>\n<li>Larvae and juveniles drift up to the surface and develop within the planktonic environment (open ocean), and often live among mats of planktonic <em>Sargassum </em>(a floating brown algae) before they move to the bottom.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n","Habitat Impacts":"Fishing gear used to harvest gray triggerfish has minimal impacts on habitat.","Image Gallery":[{src:"https://www.fishwatch.gov/sites/default/files/1.jpg",alt:"Credit: NOAA Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary/Schmahl",title:"Credit: NOAA Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary/Schmahl"},{src:"https://www.fishwatch.gov/sites/default/files/2.jpg",alt:"Gray triggerfish.

Species of <em>Alexandrium</em> cause HABs in New England that are commonly referred to as “red tides.” <em>Alexandrium</em> toxin becomes concentrated in shellfish such as surfclams. The shellfish themselves are not affected by the toxin, but eating shellfish tainted with this toxin can lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP), a potentially fatal human illness. There are large-scale monitoring programs all along the coast to assess toxin levels in shellfish; if toxins are detected these areas are immediately closed to harvesting. Contamination from PSP has had a huge impact on fisheries for surfclams. Georges Bank, where almost a third of the surfclam stock is found, has been closed to fishing since 1990 due to the presence of PSP toxins in surfclam meats. In January 2013, a portion of Georges Bank was reopened to the harvest of surfclams and ocean quahogs by vessels using a new PSP testing protocol that was developed through the collaborative efforts of industry, scientists, and managers.
