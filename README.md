My project will be a data visualization where you can find a specific fish on the U.S map, what season it is open and also show the population of the fish over the years.  Other data may include the fish limit,size, and  best bait to use. If the other data specified is not available on another API I may populate this on my own just for California.

I’m planning to use the API provided by fishwatch.gov. As far as visuals, I’m planning to use D3.

In Gone Fishing, users will be able to:

1. Search for a specific fishes
2. Search by location 
3. See a particular fish population over the years
4. When the user clicks the fish image a specific animation will occur.
5. Map will show picture of the specific fish you chose with a red circle (API doesn't have this data...) May be possible to use a second api to correlate location? If not I will do general area.

In addition, this project will include:
 1. Background music
 2. The weather/condition for that day to see if you want to go fishing(May have to pull another api)
