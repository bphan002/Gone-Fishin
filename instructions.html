    <p>The information for this application came from www.fishwatch.gov's API/p>
    <p>By using their data, a bar graph can dynamically be rendered that shows a fish's calories, and see how healthy the species population is doing by the bar color.</p>
    <p>To see a sample of what it looks like you can click on the Fish Graph in the navigation bar</p>
    <p>To create a graph you need to first add that fish. You can find a fish by scrolling through the pictured tiles or narrow it down with the search feature in the upper right</p>
    <p>Once an image is clicked you can add that fish to a graph by clicking the Add Fish to Graph button </p>
    <p>From the same position you can deselect a fish from appearing on the graph by clicking on the remove fish from graph button</p>
    <p>To reset the graph you can refresh the page</p>
